# AI Usage

This document briefly describes how I used AI tools while working on the project
“Predicting and Allocating Across Fama–French Size Portfolios with Machine Learning”.

## Tools

- **ChatGPT (GPT-5.1)**
- **GitHub Copilot** in Visual Studio Code

## ChatGPT (GPT-5.1)

I used ChatGPT mainly to:

- clarify theoretical concepts (e.g. Fama–French size portfolios, mean–variance allocation,
  walk-forward evaluation);
- discuss possible ways to structure the data / feature / modelling / allocation pipeline;
- get suggestions for improving the clarity and wording of parts of the written report;
- obtain alternative phrasings and refinements for some **code comments and short explanations**
  of functions or scripts, to better document what certain components do.

All final modelling, implementation and wording decisions are my own, and I reviewed any
suggested explanations or comments before including them.

## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot was enabled in VS Code and was used for:

- inline code completion and small snippets (loops, helper functions, repetitive patterns);
- speeding up writing boilerplate code that follows the same structure across scripts.

I reviewed, adapted and tested Copilot suggestions to ensure they matched the project’s design
and data structures.
